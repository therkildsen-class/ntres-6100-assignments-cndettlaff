# Question 1: Compute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame 
# you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Hereâ€™s an easy way to draw a map of the 
# United States:

library(maps) #install.packages("maps")

airports |>
  semi_join(flights, c("faa" = "dest")) |>
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat)) +
  borders("state") +
  geom_point() +
  coord_quickmap()

avg_delay <- flights |> 
  group_by(dest) |> 
  summarise(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  inner_join(airports, by = c(dest = "faa"))

avg_delay |> 
  ggplot(aes(lon, lat, color = delay)) +
  borders("state") + 
  geom_point() + 
  coord_quickmap()

#Question 2: Is there a relationship between the age of a plane and its delays?

# Question 1: What are the 6 most popular boy names and girl names of all time? 
# How has the popularity of each of these names changed over time?
